If you are changing languages frequently, you may want to know what language is currently being used. This is as simple as calling `moment.lang` without any parameters.

```javascript
moment.lang('en'); // set to english
moment.lang(); // returns 'en'
moment.lang('fr'); // set to french
moment.lang(); // returns 'fr'
```
